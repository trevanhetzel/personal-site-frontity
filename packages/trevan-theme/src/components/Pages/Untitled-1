Trevan Hetzel is a front-end web developer, designer and startup enthusiast. He’s currently pushing the boundaries of CSS and JavaScript as a front-end software engineer at Flywheel in Omaha, NE. Previously, Trevan has worked for appendTo, where he had the pleasure of working on and leading several large responsive redesign projects for clients like Zumba Fitness and Celebrity Cruises.

Trevan also ran a small client services agency called Hetzel Creative, and still freelances actively under that brand. He also co-hosts the Word-Break Show, a podcast that rants and raves about front-end design and development.

Trevan currently lives in Glenwood, IA and enjoys spending time with his wife and two boys. Outside of work, he reads a lot (like, a book a week), rides dirt bikes occasionally (he used to race professionally) and is learning to be a handy man (“learning” being the operative word here).
